            <h2>What data do site collects?</h2>
            <p>This site doesn’t collect any personal data, at all. Seriously, as this site is without analytics or other tracking codes it doesn’t collect anything. Only thing on site which is saved in your (view: <a href="#cookies" class="link__internal">Cookie Information’s</a>).</p>

            <h2>What private data owner and site collects?</h2>
            <p>As mentioned above site doesn’t collect any private data, but if you contact owner trough e-mail or social media you might send some of your private identification data. Those data are used only for communication with owner and you, visitor, or a client.</p>
            <h2>What about privacy policies for other linked websites?</h2>
            <p>This site contains links from and to other web sites. This privacy policy applies only to this site, and not for others. Those sites have their Privacy Policy which you can read on those sites if they collect any data and if they collect what they collect. </p>
            <h2 id="cookies">Cookie Information’s</h2>
            <h3>What are cookies?</h3>

            <h3>What cookies and scripts this site use?</h3>
            <p>This site doesn’t collect any cookies at all. Only thing that will be placed on your computer and browser is small setting which is saved in your Local Storage.</p>
            <p>That setting is named: <em>user-color-scheme</em> and it is used for saving information from Dark/Light Mode Switch which can be found in footer of site.</p>
            <p>This site also has only one functional script which is used to make fully Responsive mobile menu and Dark/Light Mode Switching, and from which is saved setting <em>user-color-scheme</em>.</p>
            <h2 id="linking">Can we link to your site?</h2>

            <p>Yes, you might see shared some Referral or Affiliate Link shared on owner’s Social Media Platforms like Facebook or Twitter. Owner can share them so he can give to all some promotional gift, help you register to site with some bonus or that he can get some bonus from your registration.</p>

            <p>Yes, yes you can.
