# Idzan Marko's Web Site

This is my personal refresh of site, built for 2021 without any CMS for it. Not even Site Generator can't do what I do with my own code.

## Ideas

* Vanilla JS for things that need JS
* HTML & CSS
* Serverless Contact form (optional)
* No Analytics and Other Things that might compromise GDPR (as I'm lazy to implement Cookie Banner and all GDPR checks, maybe one day I will implement Analytics and GDPR)
